For each work item:
1. Classify it with classifyItem.
2. If the item needs data lookup or math (e.g. a billing dispute), write a program with runCode to fetch and analyze the data — don't try to do the arithmetic in your head. Inside runCode you can call tools.getCharges and tools.searchKnowledgeBase.
3. Draft a reply with draftReply, using anything runCode computed.

Handle the items one at a time — finish all four steps for an item before starting the next. When every item is done, briefly summarize what you did`;
